title: Welcome to the Scintillometry-2018
description: Scintillometry uses cosmic plasma lenses to achieve unprecedented resolving power of coherent radio emission, including pulsars and FRBs. These sources enable a precise map of the lens structures, probe magnetic fields, and map tiny scale structures in the interstellar medium.  Low frequency VLBI has provided a new window to quantify our understanding of these enigmatic structures, and complementary use of the lenses to study the sources in microscopic detail.  This meeting brings together theory, data, and facilities, reviewing recent progress, and providing an open forum for future work.  Significant time will be allocated to topical discussions.
